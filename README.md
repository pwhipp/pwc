## Invoicing integration

This site uses the development version of django-invoicing which is linked into the site with
(pwc)~/pwc/ $ ln -s /home/paul/django-invoicing/invoicing
(pwc)~/pwc/theme/static $ ln -s /home/paul/django-invoicing/invoicing_site/invoicing_front/static/invoicing_front

Once django-invoicing is bundled as a stable app, it can be pip installed and these links can be removed.
